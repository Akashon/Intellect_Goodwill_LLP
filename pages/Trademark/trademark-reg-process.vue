                            A Trademark is any sign which can distinguish the goods and services of one trader from
                            those of another. A sign includes words, logos, colors, slogans, three-dimensional shapes
                            and sometimes sounds and gestures.

                            A trademark is, therefore, a ‘badge’ of trade origin. It is used as a marketing tool so that
                            customers can recognize the product of a particular trader. To be registrable in India it
                            must also be capable of being represented graphically, that is, in words and/or pictures.

                            <p class="font-bold">A new Trademark regime has been introduced in India since September 15,
                                2003. The new Trade
                                Marks Act, 1999 has many innovative features:</p>
                            <br />
                            [1] Service Marks: A mechanism is now available to protect marks used in the service
                            industry. Thus businesses providing services like computer hardware and software assembly
                            and maintenance, restaurant and hotel services, courier and transport, beauty and health
                            care, advertising, publishing, educational and the like are now in a position to protect
                            their names and marks.

                            </p>
                            [2] Collective Marks: Marks being used by a group of companies can now be protected by the
                            group collectively.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            [3] Well-known marks: Marks, which are deemed to be well known, are defined. Such marks will
                            enjoy greater protection. Persons will not be able to register or use marks, which are
                            imitations of well-known trademarks.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            [4] Enlarged scope of registration: Persons who get their marks registered for particular
                            goods in a particular class and commence using their marks can sue and prevent other persons
                            from
                            <br />

                            (i) Using the same or similar marks even for different goods falling in other classes;
                            <br />

                            (ii) Using the same or similar marks even only as part of their firm name or company name;
                            <br />

                            (iii) Using the same or similar mark only in advertising or on business papers;
                            <br />

                            (iv) Importing or exporting goods under the said trade mark;
                            <br />

                            (v) Unauthorized oral use of the said trademark.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            [5] Stringent punishment: Punishment for violating a trademark right has been enhanced. The
                            offence has now been made cognizable and wide powers have been given to the police to seize
                            infringing goods. At the same time, the power of the Courts to grant ex parte injunctions
                            have been amplified.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [6] Appellate Board: An appellate board (IPAB) has been constituted based in Chennai for
                            speedy disposal of Appeals and rectification applications.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [7] Expedited procedure: Mechanisms have been set in place for expediting search and
                            registration by paying five times the normal fee.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [8] Enhanced renewal period: Registered trademarks need to be renewed every ten years.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [9] License agreements do not need to be compulsorily registered.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [10] Marks may include the shape of goods.

                            <br />
                            [10] Marks may include the shape of goods.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The law is based mainly on the United Kingdom Trade Marks law and provides for the
                            registration of trademarks which are being used, or which will be used, for certain goods to
                            indicate a connection between them and some person who has the right to use the marks with
                            or without any indication as to the identity of the person.

                            <p class="font-bold">Service Mark India:</p>Service Mark Application & Litigation: The Trade
                            Marks Act, 1999 has come into force from the 15th of September 2003. An important feature of
                            the Act is the introduction of the registration of Service Marks in India. Previously,
                            Service Mark registration in India was not allowed. Protection of service marks was
                            available only under the Common Law. From September 2003, it has now become possible to
                            separately register and therefore statutorily protect Service Marks.

                            <br />

                            <p class="font-bold">Service Marks:</p>Service Marks are marks used in any form of service
                            business where actual goods under that mark are not traded. For instance, a Hotel or a
                            restaurant is a service: under the marks Wellcome group, Taj, Oyo, no goods are traded, but
                            services are offered and purchased, these marks will now be statutorily protected under the
                            Act. Similarly, marks for software services or business process outsourcing services, or
                            health, insurance, repair services or airlines services or educational services can be
                            protected by registration.

                            services; design & development of computer hardware & software; legal services. Services for
                            providing food & drink; temporary accommodation. Medical services; veterinary services;
                            hygienic and beauty care for human beings or animals; agriculture, horticulture, and
                            forestry services. Personal and social services rendered by others to meet the needs of

                            <br />
                            These are general classes. Each class has hundreds of entries for services falling under a
                            class. Thus, for instance, Compilation of information into computer databases is a service
                            falling in class 35 but a service for providing financial information is a service falling
                            in class 36. Again, a service providing Installation, maintenance, and repair of Computer
                            hardware falls in class 37 but Installation and Maintenance of Computer software falls in
                            class 42. Class 43 covers hotel and restaurant services. Medical clinics and Beauty parlors
                            fall in class 44 and horoscope casting in class 45.
