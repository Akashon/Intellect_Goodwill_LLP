                            Given its commercial potential, legal protection of GI assumes
                            enormous significance. Without suitable legal protection, the
                            competitors who do not have any legitimate rights on the GI might
                            ride free on its reputation. Such unfair business practices result
                            in loss of revenue for the genuine right-holders of the GI and
                            also misleads consumers. Moreover, such practices may eventually
                            hamper the goodwill and reputation associated with the GI.

                            </p>
                            At the international level, TRIPS sets out minimum standards of
                            protection that WTO members are bound to comply with in their
                            respective national legislations. However, as far as the scope of
                            protection of GI under TRIPS is concerned, there is a problem of
                            hierarchy. This is because, although TRIPS contains a single,
                            identical definition for all GI, irrespective of product
                            categories, it mandates a two-level system of protection: (i) the
                            basic protection applicable to all GI in general (under Article
                            22), and (ii) additional protection applicable only to the GI
                            denominating wines and spirits (under Article 23).
                            <br />
                            This kind of protection is challenging, if Article 22 fails to
                            provide sufficient intellectual property protection for the
                            benefit of the genuine right-holders of a GI. A producer not
                            belonging to the geographical region indicated by a GI may use the
                            indication as long as the product’s true origin is indicated on
                            the label, thereby free-riding on its reputation and goodwill.

                            The Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations began in 1986, precisely when India’s development
                            policy making process was at a watershed. By the time India launched its massive economic
                            reforms package in 1991, marking a paradigm shift in its policy, the Uruguay Round
                            negotiations were well under way, paving the path towards Marrakesh in 1994 and the
                            establishment of the WTO. India remained a cautious and somewhat passive player during the
                            initial years of the Uruguay Round negotiations, given its long legacy of inward looking
                            development strategy and protectionist trade policy regime.
                            <br><br>
                            However, at Doha India wanted to extend protection under ‘geographical indication’ (GI)
                            beyond wine and spirit, to other products. A number of countries] wanted to negotiate
                            extending this higher level of protection to other products as they see a higher level of
                            protection as a way to improve marketing their products by differentiating them more
                            effectively from their competitors and they object to other countries “usurping” their
                            terms. Some others opposed the move, and the debate has included the question of whether the
                            Doha Declaration provides a mandate for negotiations.
                            <br><br>
                            Those opposing extension argue that the existing (Article 22) level of protection is
                            adequate. They caution that providing enhanced protection would be a burden and would
                            disrupt existing legitimate marketing practices. India, along with a host of other
                            likeminded countries pressed an ‘extension’ of the ambit of Article 23 to cover all
                            categories of goods. However, countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand,
                            Canada, Argentina, Chile, Guatemala and Uruguay are strongly opposed to any ‘extension’. The
                            ‘extension’ issue formed an integral part of the Doha Work Programme (2001). However, as a
                            result of the wide divergence of views among WTO members, not much progress has been
                            achieved in the negotiations and the same remains as an ‘outstanding implementation issue’

                        <h5>
                            India has put in place a sui generis system of protection for GI with enactment of a law
                            exclusively dealing with protection of GIs. The legislations which deals with protection of
                            GI’s in India are ‘The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act,
                            1999’ (GI Act), and the ‘Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection)
                            Rules, 2002 (GI Rules). India enacted its GI legislations for the country to put in place
                            national intellectual property laws in compliance with India’s obligations under TRIPS.
                            Under the purview of the GI Act, which came into force, along with the GI Rules, with effect
                            from 15 September 2003, the central government has established the Geographical Indications
                            Registry with all-India jurisdiction, at Chennai, where right-holders can register their GI.
                            Unlike TRIPS], in the GI Act does not restrict itself to wines and spirits. Rather, it has
                            been left to the discretion of the central government to decide which products should be
                            accorded higher levels of protection. This approach has deliberately been taken by the
                            drafters of the Indian Act with the aim of providing stringent protection as guaranteed
                            under the TRIPS Agreement to GI of Indian origin. However, other WTO members are not
                            obligated to ensure Article 23-type protection to all Indian GI, thereby leaving room for
                            their misappropriation in the international arena.
                            The definition of GI included in Section 1(3) (e) of the Indian GI Act clarifies that for
                            the purposes of this clause, any name which is not the name of a country, region or locality
                            of that country “shall” also be considered as a GI if it relates to a specific geographical
                            area and is used upon or in relation to particular goods originating from that country,
                            region or locality, as the case may be. This provision enables the providing protection to
                            symbols other than geographical names, such as ‘Basmati’.

                            While registration of Geographical Indication Registration is not mandatory in India,
                            Section 20 (1) of the GI Act states that no person “shall” be entitled to institute any
                            proceeding to prevent, or to recover damages for, the infringement of an “unregistered” GI.
                            The registration of a GI gives its registered owner and its authorized users the right to
                            obtain relief for infringement. The GI Registry with all India jurisdictions is located in
                            Chennai with the Controller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks is the Registrar of
                            GIs, as per Section 3(1) of the GI Act. Section 6(1) further stipulates maintenance of a GI
                            Register which is to be divided into two parts: Part A and Part B. The particulars relating
                            to the registration of the GIs are incorporated in Part A, while the particulars relating to
                            the registration of the authorized users are contained in Part B (Section 7 of the Act).
                            <br>
                            A GI may be registered in respect of any or all of the goods, comprised in such class of
                            goods as may be classified by the Registrar. The Registrar is required to classify the
                            goods, as far as possible, in accordance with the International classification of goods for
                            the purposes of registration of GI (Section 8 of the Act). A single application may be made
                            for registration of a GI for different classes of goods and fee payable is to be in respect
                            of each such class of goods.

                            <br>
                            In India a GI may initially be registered for a period of ten years, and it can be renewed
                            from time to time for further periods of 10 years. Indian law place certain restrictions in
                            that a registered GI is not a subject matter of assignment, transmission, licensing, pledge,
                            mortgage or any such other agreement.

                            <p class="font-bold">Rights of Action Against Passing-Off</p>
                            The GI Act in India specifies that nothing in this Act “shall” be deemed to affect rights of
                            action against any person for passing off goods as the goods of another person or the
                            remedies in respect thereof. In its simplest form, the principle of passing-off states that
                            no one is entitled to pass-off his/her goods as those of another. The principal purpose of
                            an action against passing off is therefore, to protect the name, reputation and goodwill of
                            traders or producers against any unfair attempt to free ride on them. Though, India, like
                            many other common law countries, does not have a statute specifically dealing with unfair
                            competition, most of such acts of unfair competition can be prevented by way of action
                            against passing-off. Notably, Article 24.3 of TRIPS clearly states that in implementing the
                            TRIPS provisions on GIs, a Member is not required to diminish the protection of GIs that
                            existed in that Member immediately prior to the date of entry. This flexibility has been
                            utilised by India in the GI Act (Section 20(2)) in maintaining the right of action against
                            passing-off, which has been a part of the common law tradition of India, even prior to the
                            advent of the TRIPS Agreement. Any lawsuit relating to infringement of a registered GI or
                            for passing of an unregistered GI has to be instituted in a district court having
                            jurisdiction to try the suit. No suit shall be instituted in any court inferior to a
                            district court [Section 66 of the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and
                            Protection) Act, 1999].
