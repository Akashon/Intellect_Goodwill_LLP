                            The case of Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd v. Dabur India Ltd. & Anr. emanated from Sun
                            Pharma’s opposition to Dabur’s trademark application for “Dabur Glucorid KP (Label)” in
                            class 05. Sun Pharma initiated the opposition under the old rules, wherein the
                            responsibility for serving evidence on the opposing party rested with the Registry. Despite
                            Sun Pharma complying with the statutory deadline for filing evidence, a delay of 3 days in
                            serving the evidence on Dabur, giving rise to contentious legal proceedings. Following this
                            delay, Sun Pharma sought an extension of time and requested the learned Registrar to
                            consider its evidence on record. However, the Learned Registrar rejected Sun Pharma’s
                            request, citing the non-extendibility of the time limit prescribed by the rules, the
                            evidence served on Dabur is time-barred and consequently the opposition deeming the
                            opposition abandoned.

                            Sun Pharma, aggrieved by the ruling, filed an appeal to the High Court. With regards to Sun
                            Pharma’s plea for an extension of time, the Court affirmed that the time limits prescribed
                            by the rules are mandatory in nature and must be strictly complied with. Furthermore, the
                            Court affirmed that neither the former Trade Marks Rules 2002 nor the Trade Marks Rules 2017
                            grant the Trade Marks Registrar discretion to extend this extension.

                        <h5>
                            At the crux of the legal dispute was the question of whether the delay in serving evidence
                            warranted the abandonment of Sun Pharma’s opposition. The Delhi High Court strictly analysed
                            Rule 50 of the Repealed Rules or Trademarks Rules, 2002, which provides the procedure and
                            time limit for filing evidence in support of opposition. Emphasizing the mandatory nature of
                            these time limit, the court ruled out any discretion to extend deadlines unless specifically
                            directed by the Registrar.
                            <br><br>
                            It clarified that under both the repealed and subsequent rules, the Registrar lacked the
                            discretion to grant extensions. The interpretation of Rule 50 emphasized the importance of
                            procedural fairness and efficiency in trademark disputes, ensuring that the trademark
                            registration process remains unaffected by undue delays.

                            The ramifications of the Court’s ruling extend far beyond the confines of Sun Pharma
                            Laboratories Ltd. v. Dabur India Ltd. & Anr. The case sets a precedent for future trademark
                            opposition proceedings, establishing a framework of unwavering adherence to prescribed
                            timelines and procedural requirements.
                            <br><br>
                            Trademark owners are now compelled to exercise extensive vigilance in complying with the
                            timelines provided in the Trademarks Act and Rules. Non-compliance may lead to adverse
                            consequences, including the rejection of oppositions and potential forfeiture of substantive
                            rights. The ruling emphasizes on trademark owners and applicants to adopt a diligent view to
                            ensure the timely submission of evidence and compliance with procedural requirements.
                            <br><br>
                            Furthermore, the ruling emphasizes the role of the Registrar of Trade Marks in governing
                            trademark opposition proceedings and ensuring compliance with statutory requirements. While
                            the Registrar’s discretion in granting extensions may be curtailed, their role in
                            facilitating fair and efficient dispute resolution remains pivotal.
