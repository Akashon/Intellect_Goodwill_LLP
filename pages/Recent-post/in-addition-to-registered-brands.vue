                            A group of ministers (GoM) evaluating GST rates has decided to abolish the exception for
                            packaged food goods sold under unregistered brands. These goods will be taxed at the branded
                            food rate of 5%. The move follows the abuse of the unbranded food exemption by a segment of
                            the food processing sector, notably rice and wheat millers. According to a source, the
                            decision was made by the GoM, which convened on Friday and was led by Karnataka Chief
                            Minister Basavaraj Bommai.
                            <br><br>
                            Its term might be extended until November or December. The GoM’s ruling follows a Tripura
                            High Court verdict against Sarvasiddhi Agrotech on April 20, 2021, in which the court
                            affirmed the company’s tax claim for selling packed rice labeled Aahar standard, Aahar Gold,
                            and Aahar premium. According to the corporation, they were not brand names, but rather a
                            “internal arrangement” to signify the quality variety. The revenue department said that
                            these indications are just brand names because the supplier has not waived the actionable
                            claim/enforceable right. The GST Department has proposed a 5% tax on the products.

                            While the GST Council is inclined to consider enforcing a ministerial panel’s
                            recommendations on data analytics to tighten compliance and scrutiny of GST returns to
                            augment revenues by plugging leakages, a much-anticipated restructuring of the GST slabs to
                            raise the revenue-neutral rate (RNR) from a little more than 11 percent now to 15.5 percent
                            could begin in a small way this year in areas not prone to inflation. According to sources,
                            the government may explore boosting the GST on online gaming from 18 percent to 28 percent
                            in order to bring the skill-game tax rate in line with chance games including gambling and
                            betting.
