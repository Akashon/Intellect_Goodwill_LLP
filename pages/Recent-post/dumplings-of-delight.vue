                        <h5>
                            In India, trademarks and its registrations are governed by the Trade Marks Act, 1999
                            (hereinafter “Trade Marks Act”). The Trade Marks Act guarantees protection for trademarks
                            registered with the Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks (CGPDTM), also
                            known as the Trade Marks Registry.
                            <br><br>
                            A trademark is a symbol, design, word, or phrase capable of identifying the goods or
                            services of one business from those of others. When a trademark is registered, the owner to
                            the trademark gains “exclusive rights” to its usage.
                            <br><br>
                            According to Section 25 of the Trade Marks Act, a trademark remains valid for a period of 10
                            years after it is registered and the owner may renew the trademark periodically.
                            <br><br>
                            It is considered a violation or infringement of trademark to use someone else’s registered
                            trademark without their permission Additionally, using a substantially similar mark for
                            similar goods or services without consent is also deemed as trademark infringement.
                            <br><br>
                            In India, trademarks play a pivotal role in the food and beverage industry, contributing
                            significantly to its growth and evolution. A registered trademark stands as a cornerstone
                            for any food company or business within this sector. Registering a trademark enables a food
                            product to carve out its unique identity amidst similar offerings, thereby enhancing its
                            reputation and competitiveness.

                        <h5>
                            In a recent landmark judgment in the case of Dolma Tsering v. Mohd. Akram Khan and Another,
                            the Delhi High Court has made a significant ruling in favour of preserving the legacy of
                            ‘Dolma Aunty’ Momos. The court has taken a firm stance by cancelling and removing an
                            individual’s adoption of the registered trademark ‘DOLMA AUNTY MOMOS’. This decision follows
                            a rectification petition filed by the renowned ‘Dolma Aunty’ Momos herself on 24th September
                            2018, i.e. in the rectification proceedings titled ‘Dolma Tsering v. Mohd. Akram Khan and
                            Anr.’ The objective of the petition was to challenge and invalidate the ‘Dolma’ mark
                            obtained by Mohd. Akram Khan.
                            <br><br>
                            The judgement revolves around Dolma Tsering, the proprietor of Dolma Aunty Momos, who
                            initiated a legal action against Mohd. Akram Khan. She encountered unauthorized use of her
                            trade name by individuals selling identical products. The matter was initially brought
                            before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (“IPAB”) in 2021. However, with the
                            dissolution of the IPAB on April 4 2021, as per the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, the
                            jurisdiction was transferred to the High Courts, leading to the case being heard by the
                            Delhi High Court.
                            <br><br>
                            Dolma Tsering had established her business, Dolma Aunty Momos, in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar in
                            1994, specializing in Tibetan delicacies, particularly momos, and other products. By 2021,
                            her business had expanded to operate five outlets across Delhi-NCR, earning a solid
                            reputation for quality offerings and services. She successfully obtained the trademark
                            “Dolma Aunty Momos” in 2022, which was officially granted registration on November 17 2023.
                            She argued that Mr. Khan not only adopted a trademark identical to hers but also utilized a
                            name resembling hers. Tsering’s Rectification Petition filed against the Respondent’s
                            adoption of the “Dolma” mark claimed that it was a blatant imitation of her long-established
                            trademark. She filed a case under Sections 11(1), 11(2), 11(3)(a), and 47 of the Trade Marks
                            Act.
                            <br><br>
                            Based on the evidence and arguments presented before the Court and despite being served
                            notice, the Respondent had failed to appear, resulting in the case proceeding ex-parte. On
                            March 6 2024, the Delhi High Court ordered the cancellation and removal of respondent’s
                            trademark “Dolma Aunty Momos” from the Trade Marks Register.
                            <br><br>
                            The bench of Justice Anish Dayal held, “After considering the aforementioned facts and
                            circumstances, reviewing the documents submitted, and hearing arguments from the
                            Petitioner’s counsel, this court finds merit in the petitioner’s case. Therefore, the
                            trademark held by Respondent No. 1 is to be cancelled and removed from the Trade Marks
                            Register, and accordingly, rectified”.
                            <br><br>
                            The court has observed that Dolma Tsering had amassed a significant reputation due to the
                            widespread popularity of momos as a type of street food. Additionally, Tsering received
                            numerous accolades for the exceptional quality of her goods and services. The High Court
                            also asserted that Tsering set up a small momo shop in 1994 and was the “first retailer” of
                            the Tibetan delicacy, which had since become popular across Delhi-NCR. Since the Respondent
                            failed to appear before the court, the allegations of non-use by Tsering remained
                            unchallenged and therefore had to be acknowledged as valid.

                            This case emphasizes the significance of protecting established trademarks and the legal
                            redress accessible to trademark owners in addressing infringements by entities operating
                            within the same industry. Although this decision is interim, it highlights the potential
                            consequences of trademark infringement, particularly in cases involving confusion and
                            deception.
