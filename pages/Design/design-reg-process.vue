                                Under the Designs Act, 2000 the “article” means any article of manufacture and any
                                substance, artificial, or partly artificial and partly natural and includes any part of
                                an article capable of being made and sold separately.

                                If a group of articles meets the following requirements then that group of articles may
                                be regarded as a set of articles under the Designs Act, 2000:
                                Ordinarily on sale or intended to be used together.
                                <br />

                                Same general character. Generally, an article having the same design and sold in
                                different sizes is not considered as a set of articles. Practical example: “Tea set”,
                                “Pen set”, “Knife set” etc.

                                The design should be new or original, not previously published or used in any country
                                before the date of application for registration. The novelty may reside in the
                                application of a known shape or pattern to new Subject matter. Practical example: The
                                known shape of “Kutub Minar” when applied to a cigarette holder the same is registrable.
                                However, if the design for which application is made does not involve any real mental
                                activity for conception, then registration may not be considered.
                                <br />
                                The design should relate to features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation
                                applied or applicable to an article. Thus, designs of industrial plans, layouts, and
                                installations are not registerable under the Act.

                                Piracy of a design means the application of a design or its imitation to any article
                                belonging to a class of articles in which the design has been registered for the purpose
                                of sale or importation of such articles without the written consent of the registered
                                proprietor. Publishing such articles or exposing them for sale with knowledge of the
                                unauthorized application of the design to them also involves piracy of the design.
