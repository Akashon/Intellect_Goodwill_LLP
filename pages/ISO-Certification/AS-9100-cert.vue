                            National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) is an
                            autonomous body under the aegis of Department of Science & Technology, Government of India,
                            and is registered under the Societies Act. NABL has been established with the objective to
                            provide Government, Industry, and Society in general with a scheme for third-party
                            assessment of the quality and technical competence of testing and calibration laboratories.
                            Government of India has authorized NABL as the sole accreditation body for Testing and
                            Calibration laboratories.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In order to achieve this objective, NABL provides laboratory accreditation services to
                            laboratories that are performing tests/calibrations in accordance with NABL criteria based
                            on an internationally accepted standard for laboratory accreditation ISO/IEC 17025. These
                            services are offered in a non-discriminatory manner and are accessible to all testing and
                            calibration laboratories in India and abroad, regardless of their ownership, legal status,
                            size and degree of independence.

                            The concept of Laboratory Accreditation was developed to provide a means for third-party
                            certification of the competence of laboratories to perform specific type(s) of testing and
                            calibration.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Laboratory Accreditation provides formal recognition of competent laboratories, thus
                            providing a ready means for customers to find reliable testing and calibration services in
                            order to meet their demands.

                            <br />
                            Laboratory Accreditation enhances customer confidence in accepting testing/calibration
                            reports issued by accredited laboratories. The globalization of the Indian economy and the
                            liberalization policies initiated by the Government in reducing trade barriers and providing
                            greater thrust to exports makes it imperative for Accredited Laboratories to be at an
                            international level of competence.

                            reports issued by accredited laboratories. The society also needs to know the technically

                            <p class="font-bold">What types of laboratories can seek accreditation?</p>
                            The laboratories should be legally identifiable & appropriately registered. They can be a
                            part of a big organization or an independent entity. NABL can provide accreditation to
                            Laboratories undertaking any sort of testing or calibration in the specified fields: 
                            <br />
                            (1) Private or government laboratories; 
                            <br />
                            (2) Small operations to large multi-field laboratories;
                            <br />
                            (3) Site facilities, temporary field operations, and mobile laboratories. <br />
                            <!-- HACCP can reduce regulatory involvement (and hence costs) by replacing on-line inspection
                            with regular auditing.
                            HACCP principles can be applied to other aspects of food quality and regulatory
                            requirements.
                            Since HACCP increases one’s ability to detect poor quality product during production, such
                            product can be held before further value is added. Resources are saved and faulty product is
                            not produced. Productivity and profitability is improved.
                            HACCP improves communications between supplier and customer. It encourages businesses to
                            work together more closely and to help them understand each others capacity and
                            requirements.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            HACCP is capable of accommodating changes such as advances in raw materials, equipment and
                            premise design, procedures, and technological developments.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Communication between the different segments of the food chain improves as HACCP provides a
                            common language and a common focus on quality.
                            <br />
                            <br />
