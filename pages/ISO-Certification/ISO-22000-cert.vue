                            This International Standard ISO 22000 specifies requirements for a food safety management
                            system where an organization in the food chain needs to demonstrate its ability to control
                            food safety hazards in order to ensure that food is safe at the time of human consumption.
                            <br>
                            It is applicable to all organizations, regardless of size, which are involved in any aspect
                            of the food chain and want to implement systems that consistently provide safe products. The
                            means of meeting any requirements of this International Standard can be accomplished through
                            the use of internal and/or external resources.

                            All requirements of this International Standard (ISO 22000) are generic and are intended to
                            be applicable to all organizations in the food chain regardless of size and complexity. This
                            includes organizations directly or indirectly involved in one or more steps of the food
                            chain. Organizations that are directly involved include, but are not limited to, feed
                            producers, harvesters, farmers, producers of ingredients, food manufacturers, retailers,
                            food services, catering services, organizations providing cleaning and sanitation services,
                            transportation, storage and distribution services. Other organizations that are indirectly
                            involved include, but are not limited to, suppliers of equipment, cleaning and sanitizing

                            <br />This International Standard allows an organization, such as a small and/or less
                            developed organization (e.g. a small farm, a small packer-distributor, a small retail or
                            food service outlet), to implement an externally developed combination of control measures.
