                            <p class=" text-2xl font-bold">Overview of the ISO 9001 : 2008 standard</p>
                            <p class="font-bold">ISO 9001:2008 contains five requirements sections, each dealing with
                                one of the
                                fundamental building blocks required by any process. These are:
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p class="font-bold">Quality Management System:</p>
                            This section details the general and documentation requirements that are the foundation of
                            the management system. The general requirements ask you to look at the processes of the
                            management system, how they interact with each other, what resources you need to run the
                            processes; and how you will measure and monitor the processes. The second part of the
                            section then sets out the requirements for the documentation needed to effectively operate
                            the system and how the documentation should be controlled.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <p class="font-bold">Management Responsibility:</p>
                            The management of the systems is the responsibility of the “top management” at a strategic
                            level in the organization. The “top management” must know customers’ requirements at a
                            strategic level and make a commitment to meeting these as well as statutory and regulatory
                            requirements. “Top management” must also set policies; and to achieve these policies set
                            objectives through planning how the objectives will be met. “Top management” should also
                            ensure that there are clear internal communications and that the management system is
                            regularly reviewed.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            <p class="font-bold">Resource Management:</p>
                            This covers the people and physical resources needed to carry out the processes. People
                            should be competent to carry out their tasks and the physical resources and work environment
                            need to be capable of ensuring that the customers’ requirements are met.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <p class="font-bold">Product/Service realization:</p>
                            These are the processes necessary to produce the product or to provide the service. This is
                            the act of converting the input of the process to the output. For a manufacturing
                            organization, this may be the process of converting iron ore to steel via a blast furnace
                            for example. For a service organization, this may be the process of moving a product or
                            person from one place to another, for example, a taxi journey.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <p class="font-bold">Measurement analysis and improvement:</p>
                            These are the measurements to enable the systems to be monitored to provide information on
                            how the systems are performing with respect to the customer, the management systems
                            themselves through internal audits, the processes and the product. Analyzing these,
                            including any defect or shortfall in performance, will provide valuable information for use
                            in improving the systems and products where this is required.
                            <br />
                            Each of these five fundamental building blocks is required for any process because, if one
                            is missing, a controlled process does not occur.
                            <br />
