                            Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a prevention-based food safety
                            system. It provides a systematic method for analysing food processes, determining the
                            possible hazards and designating the critical control points necessary to prevent unsafe
                            food from reaching the consumer. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <p class="font-bold">HACCP is built around seven principles</p>
                            Analysis of food hazards: biological, chemical or physical
                            Identification of critical control points: raw materials, storage, processing, distribution
                            and consumption
                            Establishment of critical control limits and preventive measures: for example, minimum
                            cooking temperature and time.
                            Monitoring of these critical control points
                            Establishment of corrective actions
                            Keeping records
                            Systematic and regular auditing of the system in place by independent third party

                            <p class="font-bold">Benefits of Implementing HACCP</p>
                            In addition to meeting the legal and moral obligation to produce food that is safe to eat,
                            HACCP offers a variety of other benefits for not only the consumer, but for the food
                            industry and the government. The following are examples of benefits that may be gained by
                            implementing a HACCP program.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            HACCP can be applied throughout the food chain from the primary producer to final consumer.
                            HACCP reduces the need for finished product testing by identifying the hazards associated
                            with the inputs into the process and the product and devising control measures which can be
                            monitored in order to minimize or eliminate the hazards. K
                            A HACCP program, when properly designed and implemented, will significantly reduce the
                            chance of microbiological, chemical, and physical contaminants from reaching the customer.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            HACCP can reduce regulatory involvement (and hence costs) by replacing on-line inspection
                            with regular auditing.
                            HACCP principles can be applied to other aspects of food quality and regulatory
                            requirements.
                            Since HACCP increases oneâ€™s ability to detect poor quality product during production, such
                            product can be held before further value is added. Resources are saved and faulty product is
                            not produced. Productivity and profitability is improved.
                            HACCP improves communications between supplier and customer. It encourages businesses to
                            work together more closely and to help them understand each others capacity and
                            requirements.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            HACCP is capable of accommodating changes such as advances in raw materials, equipment and
                            premise design, procedures, and technological developments.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Communication between the different segments of the food chain improves as HACCP provides a
                            common language and a common focus on quality.
                            <br />
