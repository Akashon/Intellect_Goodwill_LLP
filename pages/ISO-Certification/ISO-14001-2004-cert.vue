                            management standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
                            ISO one of the world’s principal voluntary standards development bodies. The ISO 14000
                            certification standards are designed to provide an internationally recognized framework for
                            environmental management, measurement, evaluation and auditing.

                            International Standards- ISO 14001:2004 intended to provide organizations with the elements
                            of an effective environmental management system (EMS) that can be integrated with other
                            management requirements and help organizations to achieve environmental and economic goals
                            <br>
                            This International Standard specifies requirements for an environmental management system to
                            enable an organization to develop and implement a policy and objectives which take into
                            account legal requirements and information about significant environmental aspects. It is
                            intended to apply to all types and sizes of organization and to accommodate diverse
                            geographical, cultural and social conditions. The overall aim of this International Standard
                            is to support environmental protection and prevention of pollution in balance with
                            socio-economic needs.
                            <br>
                            This International Standard is based on the methodology known as Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA).
                            PDCA can be briefly described as follows. Plan: establish the objectives and processes
                            necessary to deliver results in accordance with the organization’s environmental policy. Do:
                            implement the processes.
                            <br>
                            Check: monitor and measure processes against environmental policy, objectives, targets,
                            legal and other requirements, and report the results.
