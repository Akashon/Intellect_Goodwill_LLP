                                Acquisition of Land in India refers to the process by which the union or a state
                                government in India acquires private land for the purpose of industrialization,
                                development of infrastructural facilities or urbanization of the private land, and
                                provides compensation to the affected landowners and their rehabilitation and
                                resettlement. Land acquisition in India is governed by the Right to Fair Compensation
                                and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (LARR)
                                and which came into force from 1 January 2014. Till 2013, land acquisition in India was
                                governed by the Land Acquisition Act of 1894. On 31 December 2014, the President of
                                India promulgated an ordinance with an official mandate to “meet the twin objectives of
                                farmer welfare; along with expeditiously meeting the strategic and developmental needs
                                of the country”. An amendment bill was then introduced in Parliament to endorse the
                                Ordinance. Lok Sabha passed the bill but the same is still lying for passage by the
                                Rajya Sabha. On 30 May 2015, President of India promulgated the amendment ordinance for
                                the third time. Union Government of India has also made and notified the Right to Fair
                                Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement
                                (Social Impact Assessment and Consent) Rules, 2014 under the Act to regulate the
                                procedure. The land acquisition in Jammu and Kashmir is governed by the Jammu and

                                Property tax or ‘house tax’ is a local tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land,
                                and imposed on owners. The tax power is vested in the states and it is delegated by law
                                to the local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection
                                procedures. The tax base is the annual rateable value (ARV) or area-based rating.
                                Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then
                                converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually six percent. Vacant land is
                                generally exempted from the assessment. The properties lying under control of Central
                                are exempted from the taxation. Instead, a ‘service charge’ is permissible under an
                                executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without an
                                insistence for reciprocity.

                                charged by the service provider on the receiver. However, in terms of Rule 6 of Service
                                Tax Rules, 1994, the tax is permitted to be paid on the value received. The interesting
                                thing about Service Tax in India is that the Government depends heavily on the voluntary
                                compliance of the service providers for collecting Service Tax in India.

                                liable to sales tax. There is no sales tax on the further distribution channel. VAT, in
                                simple terms, is a multi-point levy on each of the entities in the supply chain.

                                <P class="font-bold ">Securities Transaction Tax (STT):</P>
                                STT is a tax being levied on all transactions done on the stock exchanges. STT is
                                applicable on purchase or sale of equity shares, derivatives, equity-oriented funds, and
                                equity oriented Mutual Funds. Current STT on purchase or sale of an equity share is
                                0.075%. A person becomes investor after payment of STT at the time of selling securities
                                (shares). Selling the shares after 12 months comes under long term capital gains and one
                                need not have to pay any tax on that gain. In the case of selling the shares before 12
                                months, one has to pay short term capital gains @10% flat on the gain. However, for a
                                trader, all his gains will be treated as trading (Business) and he has to pay tax as per
                                tax sables. In this case, the transaction tax paid by him can be claimed back/adjusted
                                in tax to be paid.

                                The overall control for administration of Direct Taxes lies with the Union Finance
                                Ministry which functions through the Income Tax Department with the Central Board of
                                Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) at its apex. The CBDT is a statutory authority functioning under

                                dealing with matters relating to levy and collection of Direct Taxes. The Central Excise
                                Department spread over the entire country administers and collects the central excise
                                duty. The apex body that is responsible for the policy and formulation of rules is the
                                Central Board of Excise and Customs which functions under the control of the Union
                                Finance Ministry. The Central Excise officers are also entrusted with the administration
                                and collection of Service tax and the Customs duty.

                                According to S3, a sale or purchase shall be deemed to take place in the course of

                                or bailee.

                                To make a sale as one in the course of interstate trade, there must be an obligation to
                                transport the goods outside the state. The obligation may be of the seller or the buyer.
                                It may arise by reason of statute or contract between the parties or from mutual
                                understanding or agreement between them or, even from the nature of the transaction,
                                which linked the sale to such transaction. There must be a contract between the seller

                                state to another. If there is no contract, then there is no inter-state sale.

                            <p class="font-bold">A new Trademark regime has been introduced in India since September 15,
                                2003. The new Trade
                                Marks Act, 1999 has many innovative features:</p>
                            <br />
                            [1] Service Marks: A mechanism is now available to protect marks used in the service
                            industry. Thus businesses providing services like computer hardware and software assembly
                            and maintenance, restaurant and hotel services, courier and transport, beauty and health
                            care, advertising, publishing, educational and the like are now in a position to protect
                            their names and marks.
                            <br />

                            </p>
                            [2] Collective Marks: Marks being used by a group of companies can now be protected by the
                            group collectively.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            [3] Well-known marks: Marks, which are deemed to be well known, are defined. Such marks will
                            enjoy greater protection. Persons will not be able to register or use marks, which are
                            imitations of well-known trademarks.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            [4] Enlarged scope of registration: Persons who get their marks registered for particular
                            goods in a particular class and commence using their marks can sue and prevent other persons
                            from
                            <br />

                            (i) Using the same or similar marks even for different goods falling in other classes;
                            <br />

                            (ii) Using the same or similar marks even only as part of their firm name or company name;
                            <br />

                            (iii) Using the same or similar mark only in advertising or on business papers;
                            <br />

                            (iv) Importing or exporting goods under the said trade mark;
                            <br />

                            (v) Unauthorized oral use of the said trademark.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            [5] Stringent punishment: Punishment for violating a trademark right has been enhanced. The
                            offence has now been made cognizable and wide powers have been given to the police to seize
                            infringing goods. At the same time, the power of the Courts to grant ex parte injunctions
                            have been amplified.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [6] Appellate Board: An appellate board (IPAB) has been constituted based in Chennai for
                            speedy disposal of Appeals and rectification applications.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [7] Expedited procedure: Mechanisms have been set in place for expediting search and
                            registration by paying five times the normal fee.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [8] Enhanced renewal period: Registered trademarks need to be renewed every ten years.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [9] License agreements do not need to be compulsorily registered.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            [10] Marks may include the shape of goods.

                            <br />
                            [10] Marks may include the shape of goods.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The law is based mainly on the United Kingdom Trade Marks law and provides for the
                            registration of trademarks which are being used, or which will be used, for certain goods to
                            indicate a connection between them and some person who has the right to use the marks with
                            or without any indication as to the identity of the person.

                            the Act is the introduction of the registration of Service Marks in India. Previously,
                            Service Mark registration in India was not allowed. Protection of service marks was
                            available only under the Common Law. From September 2003, it has now become possible to
                            separately register and therefore statutorily protect Service Marks.

                            <p class="font-bold">Service Marks:</p>Service Marks are marks used in any form of service
                            business where actual goods under that mark are not traded. For instance, a Hotel or a
                            restaurant is a service: under the marks Wellcome group, Taj, Oyo, no goods are traded, but
                            services are offered and purchased, these marks will now be statutorily protected under the
                            Act. Similarly, marks for software services or business process outsourcing services, or
                            health, insurance, repair services or airlines services or educational services can be
                            protected by registration.

                            These are general classes. Each class has hundreds of entries for services falling under a
                            class. Thus, for instance, Compilation of information into computer databases is a service
                            falling in class 35 but a service for providing financial information is a service falling
                            in class 36. Again, a service providing Installation, maintenance, and repair of Computer
                            hardware falls in class 37 but Installation and Maintenance of Computer software falls in
                            class 42. Class 43 covers hotel and restaurant services. Medical clinics and Beauty parlors
                            fall in class 44 and horoscope casting in class 45.
