                            IP is a type of intangible property, which has been created by one’s own intelligence. It is
                            the result of a person’s intellectual property. Thus, Intellectual Property refers to
                            creation from one’s mind such as inventions, designs for industrial articles, literary,
                            artistic work, symbols which are ultimately used in commerce. Intellectual Property Rights
                            allow the creators or owners to have the benefits from their works when these are exploited
                            commercially. These rights are statutory rights governed in accordance with the provisions
                            of corresponding legislation. Intellectual Property rights reward creativity & human
                            endeavor which fuels the progress of humankind.

                            The intellectual property is classified into different categories i.e. a. Patents b. Designs
                            c. Trade Marks d. Copyright e. Geographical Indications f. Lay out designs of integrated
                            circuits g. Protection of undisclosed information/Trade Secret according to TRIPS, Plant

                            the name of a person, living or dead.

                            For the purpose of registration, a mark chosen should be capable of distinguishing goods or
                            services of one person from those of the others. Further it should not be deceptively
                            similar to an existing mark of another person and not the one expressly prohibited under the
                            Act.

                            The marks devoid of any distinctive character, or which are only indicative of the kind,

                            already in vogue in the trade due to their customary use may not be registered. But these
                            disqualifications do not apply to marks, which have already acquired distinction due to
                            their popularity and consistent use. Internationally acclaimed brand names are freely

                            its mark for goods as well as services.
                            A person may apply for registration of a trade mark to the Trademark office under whose
                            jurisdiction the principal place of the business of the applicant in India falls.
                            In case, the principal place of business is outside India, then the application can be filed
                            in the Trademark office under whose jurisdiction the office of the lawyer appointed by you
                            is located.
                            In case of a company about to be formed, anyone may apply in his name for subsequent
                            assignment of the registration in the company’s favour.
                            Before making an application for registration it is prudent to conduct a trademark search in
                            the Trademark office in context of the already registered trademarks to ensure that
                            registration may not be denied in view of resemblance of the proposed mark to an existing
                            one or prohibited one.

                            Sometimes purchase of articles for use is influenced not only by their practical efficiency
                            but also by their appearance. The important purpose of design Registration is to see that
                            the artisan, creator, originator of a design having aesthetic look is not deprived of his
                            bonafide reward because of others applying it to their goods.

                        <h5>
                            (1) The design should be new or original, not previously published or used in any country
                            before the date of application for registration. The novelty may reside in the application
                            of a known shape or pattern to new subject matter. Practical example: The known shape of
                            “Lal-kila” when applied to a rice holder the same is registrable. However, if the design for
                            which application is made does not involve any real mental activity for conception, then
                            registration may not be considered.
                            <br />

                            (2) The design should relate to features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation
                            applied or applicable to an article. Thus, designs of industrial plans, layouts and
                            installations are not registrable under the Act.
                            <br />

                            (3) The design should be applied or applicable to any article by any industrial process.
                            Normally, designs of artistic nature like painting, sculptures and the like which are not
                            produced in bulk by any industrial process are excluded from registration under the Act.
                            <br />

                            (4) The features of the design in the finished article should appeal to and are judged
                            solely by the eye.
                            <br />

                            (5) Any mode or principle of construction or operation or anything which is in substance a
                            mere mechanical device, would not be registrable design.
                            <br />

                            (6) The design should not include any Trade Mark or property mark or artistic works as
                            defined under the Copyright Act, 1957.
                            <br />

                            When does the Applicant for Registration of Design get the registration certificate?

                            When an application for registration of a Design is in order, it is accepted and registered
                            and then a certificate of registration is issued to the applicant.

                            The Controller of Designs is a document maintained by The Patent Office, Kolkata as a
                            statutory requirement. It contains the design number, class number, date of filing (in this
                            country) and reciprocity date (if any), name and address of Proprietor and such other
                            matters as would affect the validity of proprietorship of the design and it is open for
                            public inspection on payment of prescribed fee & extract from register may also be obtained
                            on request with the prescribed fee.

                            years. Different steps of registration of a Patent : –
                            <br />

                            STEP 1: Request the Patent Search Study.
                            <br />
                            STEP 2: Request the Patent Application.
                            <br />
                            STEP 3: Once your patent has been granted, obtain your Patent Issue.
                            The attorneys in charge of your registration will complete each one of the above procedures.
                            <br />

                            For the patent services we have separated the process in 3 different stages that we call
                            ‘Steps’:
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            STEP 1 Patent Search –
                            <br />
                            STEP 2 Patent Application –
                            <br />

                            STEP 3 Patent is issued.
                            <br />

                            The reason for the separation is that you pay only for the services received, and only when
                            you advance in the process of registration you are advised to request the following
                            service(s).
