                            Industrial designs refer to creative activity which result in the ornamental or formal
                            appearance of a product and design right refers to a novel or original design that is
                            accorded to the proprietor of a validly registered design. Industrial designs are an element
                            of intellectual property. Under the TRIPS Agreement, minimum standards of protection of
                            industrial designs have been provided for. As a developing country, India has already
                            amended its national legislation to provide for these minimal standards.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The essential purpose of design law it to promote and protect the design element of
                            industrial production. It is also intended to promote innovative activity in the field of
                            industries. The existing legislation on industrial designs in India is contained in the New
                            Designs Act, 2000 and this Act will serve its purpose well in the rapid changes in
                            technology and international developments. India has also achieved a mature status in the
                            field of industrial designs and in view of globalization of the economy, the present
                            legislation is aligned with the changed technical and commercial scenario and made to
                            conform to international trends in design administration.
