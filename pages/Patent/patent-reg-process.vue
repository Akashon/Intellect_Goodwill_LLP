                                Failure to do so could result in the refusal of the application in case it is opposed or

                                After three years from the date of sealing of a patent, an interested party may apply to
                                the Controller for the grant of a compulsory license alleging that the reasonable
                                requirements of the public with respect to the invention have not been satisfied or that
                                the invention is not available at reasonable price. If the Controller is satisfied that
                                a prima facie case for an applicant for compulsory license has been made out, he shall
                                serve notice on the patentees who, if they so desire, may oppose the application for
                                compulsory license.

                                It is not compulsory but advisable as otherwise damages may be difficult to recover in
                                cases of infringement. The invention may be marked with the word “Patented” or “Patent”
                                accompanied by the number and year of the patent.

                                An infringement suit may be instituted by a patentee or his exclusive licensee. Every
                                ground for revocation is available as a defense and revocation can be counter claimed in
                                infringement proceedings. The Court may grant relief in respect of a valid claim or
                                claims even though one or more other claims in the suit may be held to be invalid.
                                Relief may include damages and costs as awarded by the court. A suit for injunction may
                                be instituted and damages recovered in cases where there have been groundless threats.
                                Any person may institute a suit for declaration as to non-infringement of a patent. Onus
                                of proof of non-infringement lies with the defendant.

                                It is possible to patent programs for computers which, when running on a computer
                                produce a “technical effect or includes hardware”. However, if a program does not
                                produce a technical effect when run on a computer it is unlikely to be patentable. A
                                technical effect is generally an improvement in technology and needs to be in an area of
                                technology, which is patentable. For instance, an improved program for translating
                                between Japanese and English is not patentable because linguistics is a mental process,
                                not a technical field. On the other hand, a program, which speeds up image enhancement,
                                may be patentable because it produces a technical improvement in a technical area.

                                Some countries, such as the USA, which may be a large potential market for your
                                software, have a more liberal approach to software patenting and often grant patents for
                                software, which would be excluded in India and other countries.
                                <br />
                                Deciding whether or not a particular computer program is patentable is a complex issue
                                and advice from a Patent Agent may help to determine which is the most effective form of
                                protection available.
