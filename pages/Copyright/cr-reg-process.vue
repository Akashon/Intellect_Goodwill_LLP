                        <h5>
                            Copyright Registration in India gives the creators of a wide range of material, such as
                            literature, art, music, sound recordings, films and broadcasts, economic rights enabling
                            them to control use of their material in a number of ways, such as by making copies, issuing
                            copies to the public, performing in public, broadcasting and use on-line. It also gives
                            moral rights to be identified as the creator of certain kinds of material and to object to
                            its distortion or its mutilation. (Material protected by copyright is termed a “work”.)
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <p>However, copyright does not protect ideas, names or titles. The purpose of copyright law
                                in India is to allow copyright registrants to gain economic rewards for their efforts
                                and so encourage future creativity and the development of new material which benefits us
                                all. Copyright material is usually the result of creative skill and/or significant
                                labour and/or investment and without protection, it would often be very easy for others
                                to exploit material without paying the creator. Most uses of copyright material
                                therefore require permission from the copyright owner. However there are exceptions to
                                copyright, so that some minor uses may not result in copyright infringements.</p>

                                Copyright protection is automatic as soon as there is a record in any form of the
                                material that has been created. Under the Indian Copyright Act there is a provision to
                                register copyright although this is voluntary.
                                Owner of Copyright
                                In the case of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, the general rule is that
                                the author, i.e. the person who created the work, is the first owner of the economic
                                rights under copyright. However, where such a work is made in the course of employment,
                                the employer is the first owner of these rights, unless an agreement to the contrary has
                                been made with the author.
                                <br />

                                In the case of a sound recording the record producer is the author and first owner of
                                copyright; in the case of a broadcast, the broadcaster; and in case of a published
                                edition, the publisher.

                                Copyright is, however, a form of property which, like physical property, can be bought
                                or sold, inherited or otherwise transferred, wholly or in part. So, some or all of the
                                economic rights may subsequently belong to someone other than the first owner. In
                                contrast, the moral rights accorded to authors of literary, dramatic, musical and
                                artistic works and film directors remain with the author or director or pass to his or
                                her heirs on death. Copyright in material produced by a Government department belongs to
                                the Government of India.

                                Copyright owners generally have the right to authorise or prohibit any of the following
                                things in relation to their works:

                            Copyright is infringed when any of the above acts are done without authorisation, whether
                            directly or indirectly and whether the whole or a substantial part of a work, unless what is
                            done falls within the scope of exceptions to copyright permitting certain minor uses of

                            It is important to remember that just buying or owning the original or a copy of a copyright
                            work does not give you permission to use it the way you wish. For example, buying a copy of
                            a book, CD, video, computer program etc does not necessarily give you the right to make
                            copies (even for private use), play or show them in public. Other everyday uses of copyright
                            material, such as photocopying, scanning, downloading from a CD-ROM or on-line database, all
                            involve copying the work. So, permission is generally needed. Also, use going beyond an
                            agreed licence will require further permission.
